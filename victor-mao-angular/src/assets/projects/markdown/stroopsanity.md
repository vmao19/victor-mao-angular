# Goal #

Led a team of three and created an original 2D computer game using **C#**.

# Description #

Stroopsanity is a one-player 2D computer game developed using the [Unity Game Engine](https://unity3d.com/). The game is based on the [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect), which is a demonstration of delayed reaction time due to conflicting word definitions and colors.

# To Play #

Download the zip, which includes Stroopsanity.exe and Stroopsanity_data. Unzip. Click Stroopsanity.exe to start the game. Use the left and right arrow keys to move. You score points when you collect a falling trash whose color corresponds with the word displayed and NOT the color of the word displayed. You lose one life if you collect trash of the wrong color, and you have 5 lives to lose before the game is over.
