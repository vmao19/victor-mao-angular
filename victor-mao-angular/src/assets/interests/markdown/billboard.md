# Goal #

Automatically scrape the Billboard Top 100 RSS feed and save the data to a google drive spreadsheet.

# Description #

I wrote a Google Script that automatically scrapes the Billboard Top 100 RSS feed every week and saves the data to a google drive spreadsheet.

I collected weekly data starting July 26, 2014 to December 30, 2017.

At the time of the project, the RSS feed URL was https://www.billboard.com/rss/charts/hot-100. This RSS feed was deprecated at the beginning of 2018, so my scraper does not work anymore.
